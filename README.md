## üìÑ About this Project

Apto is designed to help everyone learn more information on what supplements to take for a variety of performance or health related goals. Many businesses are not explaining the basic effect or goal of these supplements, but rather sayinig it will just make you look like whatever influencer is marketing the product. Apto will allow users to become more aware of what they are taking and the overall effect it has on their actual performance or health.  

## üåü Highlights

Here are the current and future features of Apto:

- Reliable information on all supplements that we can get our hands on
- View supplements that affect your goal!
- Market information will appear showing products currently being sold on the market that are recommended for specific supplements or goals
- User profiles
- Wishlists can be created to store supplements or goals that users want to go back and see
- User reviews to store opinions on supplements taken

Future ideas
- Features more focused towards gym media for sharing and messaging other users
- Creaing a custom blend of supplements to see overall effect or if it is on the market already

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

A good README should include a brief overview section with a paragraph or two explaining what the software does, how it works, and who made it.
Feel free to include 2-3 subsections here with relevant information in regards to who you are and how the software is relevant in a broader ecosystem of software (perhaps respectfully compare your software to other solutions out there).
